# Python daemon console app for the Microsoft Graph
Based on the extensive tutorial available here:

https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-daemon/1-Call-MsGraph-WithSecret

See the README.md in the original repo for details.

Some of my changes included using python-dotenv for storing and retrieving
the app's client id and secret, reconfiguring for the beta version of the
API and experimenting with filters, etc.
